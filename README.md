 <li>Please complete the table of binary operations for the Dihedral Group. I have posted a blank table in this Module for you to fill in. Feel free to expand or modify it  (widen columns etc)</li>

 <li>Is the group commuative? why or why not?</li>

 <li>Does it have any subgroups you can identify?</li>

 <li>In general, suppose we have a group which has a generator. Meaning all other members of the group are a power of that generator.  What are the pros and cons of viewing the group that way?  What do you feel is a good example?  What might this have to do with logs ?</li>
